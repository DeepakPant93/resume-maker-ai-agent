## Features

### FastAPI Endpoints:

-   `/upload-docs`: API endpoint to upload documents for creating embeddings.
-   `/ask`: API endpoint for querying the system and receiving context-aware answers.

### Poetry for Dependency Management:

-   Simplifies package installation and management.
-   Ensures compatibility and reproducibility of the project environment.

### Scalable Architecture:

-   Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
-   Easy integration of new features or pipelines.
